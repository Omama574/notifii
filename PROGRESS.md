# Build log — Echo + Notifii (two apps)

This file is the hand-off between sessions. The same file lives in both repos:
- **Echo** (deleted-messages app, ads + one-time "Remove ads") → `github.com/Omama574/app` (folder `echo/`)
- **Notifii** (offline "ladder" notification app, one-time Pro) → `github.com/Omama574/notifii`, branch `ladder-v1`

If you're a new session: read this file top to bottom, then continue from **Next steps**.

## Decisions (locked with the user)
- Two apps. Echo first (mass-market download magnet), Notifii second (offline, privacy brand).
- Notifii: **no INTERNET permission, no account — non-negotiable.** Echo may use internet **only for ads**; messages never leave the phone.
- Money: Echo = in-feed native ads (AdMob) + one-time "Remove ads". Notifii = free core + one-time Pro. **No subscriptions, no interstitials, no app-open ads.**
- Payments: Google Play Billing (required by Play for digital goods). No server; purchases restored locally with `queryPurchasesAsync`.
- Auto-reply: later (not v1).
- UX is the moat: one mental model per app, value before asks, just-in-time permissions.

## Mental models
**Echo:** "Your chats, plus the messages people deleted." Two tabs: **Chats** (every saved conversation) and **Deleted** (the hero feed). Chat view looks like a messenger; deleted bubbles are marked, edited messages show the original.

**Notifii:** every app/person sits on one rung of a ladder — **Siren** (rings through silent/DND until handled) · **Ring** (normal; default) · **Later** (held, delivered in a digest) · **Hide** (never shown). **Everything is always kept in the Vault**, so nothing is ever lost. Exceptions are made from a real notification ("Upwork is Later, except 'invited you' → Siren"), previewed against the Vault, and every action explains **Why?**. Night window: Ring behaves like Later; Siren still rings. Tabs: **Now · Ladder · Vault**. Free calms your phone; Pro (Siren + exceptions beyond 1) makes sure you never miss.

## Design rules we follow (from research)
- Value before any ask; one activation moment; aim for value inside 60 s; ask permissions at the moment they're needed ([Userpilot](https://userpilot.com/blog/contextual-experience/), [Eleken](https://eleken.co/blog-posts/mobile-app-onboarding-best-practices)).
- Material 3: colour roles, 8 dp grid, 48 dp touch targets, 4.5:1 text contrast, dark theme, type scale, themed motion, restraint ([M3 in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/themes/material3), [Androidify](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/androidify-building-delightful-ui-with-compose.html)).
- Native ads: in the feed, visually distinct, labelled "Ad", AdChoices, nothing overlapping ([AdMob native policy](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6329638), [playbook](https://admob.google.ca/home/resources/native-ads-playbook)).
- Paywall: one product, stripped back, benefit clarity ([RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/paywall-conversion-boosters.md)).
- Play requires targetSdk 36 for new apps since 31 Aug 2026 ([Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk)).

## Toolchain (known-good on the dev machine)
AGP 8.13.2 · Gradle 8.13 · Kotlin 2.0.21 · KSP 2.0.21-1.0.27 · Compose BOM 2025.02.00 · Room 2.6.1 · compileSdk/targetSdk 36 · minSdk 26 · JDK 17.

## Status
- [x] Research + decisions
- [x] Echo: skeleton builds
- [x] Echo: capture engine + deletion detection (+ 7 unit tests, passing)
- [x] Echo: UI (onboarding, chats, chat, deleted, search, settings)
- [x] Echo: ads (UMP consent + native) + Remove-ads billing (compiles; real purchase needs Play Console)
- [x] Echo: Android Lint, 0 errors
- [ ] Echo: emulator smoke test + screenshots (BLOCKED: see Next steps 1)
- [x] Notifii: rebuilt on ladder model (+ 16 unit tests: decisions, exceptions, amounts, bursts, night window, digest times)
- [x] Notifii: UI (onboarding, now, ladder, vault, why/exception sheets, siren screen, paywall, siren check)
- [x] Notifii: billing with INTERNET stripped from merged manifest (build fails if it ever comes back; verified)
- [x] Notifii: Android Lint, 0 errors (fixed: unchecked notification permission in digest; API 26 crash on the Siren screen)
- [ ] Notifii: emulator smoke test + screenshots (BLOCKED: see Next steps 1)

## What we need from the user (blocking only for release, not for building)
1. Final app names + package IDs (working: `app.echo.messages`, `com.notifii.app`). Package IDs can't change after first upload.
2. Google Play Console account ($25 one-time) + payments profile.
3. AdMob account → real App ID + native ad unit ID (code uses Google's **test IDs** now).
4. In Play Console create in-app products: Echo `remove_ads`, Notifii `notifii_pro` (one-time, non-consumable).
5. A hosted privacy-policy URL for each app (GitHub Pages works; drafts are in `PRIVACY.md`).

## How to continue
```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest   # logic tests
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug       # build
```

## Next steps
1. **On-device test is blocked on the dev machine:** C: has ~2 GB free and D: ~6.3 GB, but a new emulator needs 7.3 GB, and the existing `SA_API34` AVD has a lock-screen PIN (apps can't start until it's unlocked). Unblock with any one of: free ~1 GB on D:, share the SA_API34 PIN, or plug in a phone with USB debugging, then run the steps below.
2. Echo end-to-end: `adb shell cmd notification allow_listener app.echo.messages/app.echo.messages.capture.CaptureService`, then in debug builds `adb shell am broadcast -n app.echo.messages/.DebugSimulator --ei step 1` (then 2, 3, 4) to simulate a chat, a deletion, a group chat and an edit.
3. Notifii end-to-end: allow listener `com.notifii.app/com.notifii.app.service.ListenerService`, post test notifications with `adb shell cmd notification post -t "Title" tag "text"`, and use Settings → Test Siren.
4. Before release: real AdMob IDs, Play Console products, privacy-policy URLs, release signing, Play declarations (Notification listener use, full-screen intent for Notifii's Siren, mediaPlayback foreground service, battery-optimisation exemption).

## Known limits (honest list)
- Both apps only see messages that arrive as notifications. Chats read while open in the messenger aren't captured.
- Echo deletion detection: placeholder text (common languages) + "message vanished from the notification" heuristic. If the deleted message was the only one, the messenger usually removes the notification, which can't be told apart from "read".
- Notifii: after a phone restart, tapping an old Vault entry opens the app, not the exact chat (Android doesn't let apps save tap targets).
- Dev machine: C: drive is ~99% full, which makes builds and emulators slow or fail.
